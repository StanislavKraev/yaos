here are seven processor modes:
Mode 		Bits 	Description 	Family
User 	usr 	%10000 	Normal program execution, no privileges 	All
FIQ 	fiq 	%10001 	Fast interrupt handling 	All
IRQ 	irq 	%10010 	Normal interrupt handling 	All
Supervisor 	svc 	%10011 	Privileged mode for the operating system 	All
Abort 	abt 	%10111 	For virtual memory and memory protection 	ARMv3+
Undefined 	und 	%11011 	Facilitates emulation of co-processors in hardware 	ARMv3+
System 	sys 	%11111 	Runs programs with some privileges 	ARMv4+

 User mode

This is the mode in which user application tasks should run. It has access to the base register set, and no privileges. 

 SVC mode

This is the privileged mode reserved for the operating system. R13, R14, and CPSR are shadowed.

OS calls (SWI) set the processor to SVC mode, and then the processor jumps to &8 (or &FFFF0008).

After system reset, the ARM begins processing at address &0 (or &FFFF0000 if high vectors configured), 
with interrupts disabled and in SVC mode. This address is the location of the Reset Vector, 
which should be a branch to the reset code.
