ARM architecture

The Cortex-A7 MPCore processor implements the ARMv7-A architecture with the following architecture extensions:
    Advanced Single Instruction Multiple Data version 2 (SIMDv2) architecture extension for integer and floating-point vector operations.
    Note

    The Advanced SIMD architecture extension, its associated implementations, and supporting software, are commonly referred to as NEON technology.
    Vector Floating-Point version 4 (VFPv4) architecture extension for floating-point computation that is fully compliant with the IEEE 754 standard.
    Security Extensions for implementation of enhanced security.
    Virtualization Extensions for the development of virtualized systems that enable the switching of guest operating systems.
    Large Physical Address (LPA) Extension for address translation of up to 40 bit physical addresses.
    Multiprocessing Extensions for multiprocessing functionality.
    

Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architectures

The Cortex-A7 MPCore processor ACE and debug interfaces comply with the:
    AMBA 4 Advanced eXtensible Interface (AXI) protocol. See the AMBA AXI Protocol Specification.
    AMBA 3 Advanced Peripheral Bus (APB) protocol. See the AMBA APB Protocol Specification.
    

Interfaces

The Cortex-A7 MPCore processor has the following external interfaces:
    ACE.
    APB.
    ETM.
    Design For Test (DFT).
    Memory Built-In Self Test (MBIST) controller.
